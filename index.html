        <h2>Kinan Khaskieh</h2>
        <p>I am studying Computer Science with a standing of Senior 1. During my studies at AUS my favorite topics to study are computer vision and cyber security.  To cool my head of studying I enjoy playing chess in my short breaks and game development during long breaks. I have a passion for redesigning retro games to add my own touch and modifications, or to get the game to work on my own device. </p>

        <h2>Omar Elshall</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the American University of Sharjah with a strong foundation in web development and problem-solving. Beyond coding, I have years of experience in graphic and motion design, collaborating with brands, esports teams, and content creators to craft unique visuals. I thrive on bringing ideas to life—whether through sleek websites, bold branding, or dynamic motion graphics. When I'm not working on a project, you'll probably find me at the gym, brainstorming new concepts, or fine-tuning the smallest design details.</p>
